## The Name
When deciding about a name for blog where it might be just about anything the struggle was real, but since I do tend to really nerd into every topic I get a hand on trying it really shouldn't be that hard. Therefore it became a Nerdocracy, rule by nerds since its paraphrase from democracy, theocracy, aristocracy and so on.

What a nerdocracy is and should be I do not know, but i would suppose that is more that of a aristocracy than a democracy. And since this is a somewhat personal space for thoughts, novels and maybe pods it might even be a autocracy, 'One ring to rule them all' so to speak.

## Who am I
And as Jean Valjean sings when he appears in front of the court to save the innocent from being condemd as him, 'Who am I?'. That is a good question and to answer it easy. Nobody special, just a geek, nerd and enthusiast from Sweden that wants a space to write on. My name though is Oliver, and on other places you could find my under my handle 'lyzio'.
